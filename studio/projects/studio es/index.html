          <p>	OLD KIM
            Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            Why is it snowing, grandma? Where does it come 
            from?
            
                    OLD KIM
            Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            I want to hear.
            
                    OLD KIM
            Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.
            
                    OLD KIM
            Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would 
            have to start with scissors.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            Scissors?
            
                    OLD KIM
            Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once 
            there was even a man who had scissors for 
            hands.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            A man?
            
                    OLD KIM
            Yes.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            Hands, scissors?
            
                    OLD KIM
            No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top 
            of the mountain?
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            It's haunted.
            
                    OLD KIM
            Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in 
            that mansion. He made many things, I suppose. 
            He also created a man. He gave him inside, a 
            heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost 
            everything. You see, the inventor was very old. 
            He died before he got to finish the man he 
            invented. So the man was left by himself, 
            incomplete and all alone.
            
                    GRANDDAUGHTER
            He didn't have a name?
            
                    OLD KIM
            Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward.</p>

          <p>Burton conceived Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox after Warner Bros. declined. Edward Scissorhands was then fast-tracked after Burton's critical and financial success with Batman. The film also marks the fourth collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman, and was Vincent Price's last film role to be released in his lifetime.</p>

            You know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am. 
            You could have taken care of this by yourself.

            I could? I don't think so.

            Yeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's 
            clogged. That's all. You see this bolt here? 
            You just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops.

            You know, on TV they say you repairmen are 
            lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely 
            too. Although you may not realize it since they 
            haven't made a commercial on the subject.

            because it fits in there by itself. And then 
            you just screw this back on.

          <p>The genesis of Edward Scissorhands came from a drawing by then-teenaged director Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want to leave me alone for some reason, I don't know exactly why." During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands.[6] "Every detail was so important to Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked.[7] She wrote Scissorhands as a "love poem" to Burton, stating "He is the most articulate person I know but I couldn't tell you a single complete sentence he has ever said".[8]</p>

		You hear that, Mr. Boggs?

            <p>Shortly after Thompson's hiring, Burton began to develop Edward Scissorhands at Warner Bros., with whom he worked on Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Batman. However, within a couple of months, Warner sold the film rights to 20th Century Fox.[9] Fox agreed to finance Thompson's screenplay while giving Burton complete creative control. At the time, the budget was projected to be around $8–9 million.[10] When writing the storyline, Burton and Thompson were influenced by Universal Horror films, such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Phantom of the Opera (1925), Frankenstein (1931), and Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), as well as King Kong (1933) and various fairy tales. Burton originally wanted to make Scissorhands as a musical, feeling "it seemed big and operatic to me", but later dropped the idea.[11] Following the enormous success of Batman, Burton arrived to the status of being an A-list director. He had the opportunity to do any film he wanted, but rather than fast track Warner Bros.' choices for Batman Returns[6] or Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian, Burton opted to make Edward Scissorhands for Fox.[12]</p>

		Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you 
		have the whole family in there, don't you?
		
				KEVIN
		Edward, come here.
			(Kevin cleans Edward's 
			scissorhands with water.)
		
				BILL
		No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to 
		the garage and get the oil can. We don't want 
		him rusting up on this now, do we?
		
				PEG
		Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us.
		
				BILL
		Yes, it is.
		
				PEG
		Oh, Edward.
			(Esmeralda comes near.)
		
				ESMERALDA
		It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from 
		the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan 
		is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the 
		poor sheep strayed so far from the path.
		
				EDWARD
		We are not sheep.
		
				ESMERALDA
		Don't come near me.
		
				BILL
		That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run!
		
				PEG
		Edward, don't you listen to her.
		
				BILL
		Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an 
		old lonely loony. That's all.
			(Women knock on the door.)
		
				WOMEN
		Hi!
		
				JOYCE
		You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old 
		hermit crabs.
		
				PEG
		Hi, Joyce. Hi!
		
				JOYCE
		Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to 
		yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of 
		you.
		
				PEG
		No, it, it's... things have just been a little 
		hectic around here. That's all.
		
				JOYCE
		Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct 
		the situation. What time does the barbecue 
		begin?
		
				PEG
		Barbecue?
		
				JOYCE
		Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality 
		by introducing him to your friends, don't you?
		
				ANOTHER WOMAN
		I'll bring coleslaw.
		
				JOYCE
		And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time 
		was it that you said?
		
				PEG
		What time? Ah... bill.
		
				JOYCE
		About five?
		
				ESMERALDA
		He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's 
		not too late. You must push him from you. Expel 
		him. Trample down the perversion of nature.
		
				JOYCE
		Did you hear that? He's the perversion of 
		nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you 
		later. Bye bye.
		
				PEG
		I've always said that you really can't have a 
		picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs. 
		They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh, 
		dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know 
		you chopped all those things. What a really 
		big...
			(Peg notices a cut on his face.)
		Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no 
		need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda 
		won't be here and the rest of neighbors there 
		are really very nice. There's no need to be 
		nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You 
		just have to be yourself.
		
				EDWARD
		Myself?
